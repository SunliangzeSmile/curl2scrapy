## [Curl2Scrapy][1]

Tiny helper tool to speed up  Scrapy request debugging.

 -  Copy request as CURL in your browser
 -  Paste resulting code to the left pane
 -  Press the button or Ctrl + Enter
 -  Profit!
 
 This tool was inspired by [Trillworks Curl Tool][2], which was helping me for years, but lacks Scrapy syntax unfortunately.

 ### Changelog

 Added translate on paste event handler.
 Regexps updated to handle simple curl requests(probably).
